# sandpiles

openCL code for Julia 0.5/0.6 which can be used to generate large sandpiles quickly.

 - example.jl has examples.

 -  http://home.uchicago.edu/~ahmedb/sandpiles/sandpiles.html has sandpile pictures.

----


this code is now DEPRECATED as openCL doesn't appear to work with the latest version of Julia 

- navigate to
